              Studies have shown that a good work-life balance is very important to be happy in a new country. Also getting to know the country is an important factor to feel at home. The Netherlands is an easy country to travel around in. Public transport is fast and safe. Because Schiphol is the third biggest airport in Europe, you can fly cheap for a weekend to any destination in Europe.

              <h2>Favorite destinations in Europe</h2>
              
              <ul style="list-style:decimal">
                <li>Our number one is the Greece islands with Santorini as favorite island. The views from these towns on this island which are located 500 meter above the sea on a volcano are breathtaking. Transavia flies daily to Santorini.</li>
                <br>
                <li>Our second favorite destination: Cinque terre in Italy. It is a very colorful and beautiful part of Italy with amazing views.  You can hike to each of the beautiful 5 towns and take a little train back when you are tired. You can fly to Pisa for already 40 euro and take a train from there.</li>
                <br>
                <li>Our number three Switzerland. Yes it is quite expensive but if you love mountains and lakes it is the perfect destination. It is a very safe and clean country and the views will give you goosebumps.</li>
                <br>
                <li>Our top four is in Italy again. And is called lake Como. Yes it can be touristy but if you go in Autumn or in Spring you have great temperatures and the old little towns around lake Como are breathtaking with the purple autumn colors. You can fly cheap to Milan in an hour and take a short train ride from there to lake Como.</li>
                <br>
                <li>Our top five destination is Portugal. Lisbon is one of the most beautiful European cities with a rich history. Also the wine areas around Lisbon and the beaches in the south of Portugal will not disappoint you.</li>
                <br>
                <li>Our top 6 destination: Scandinavia. If you love nature Norway and Sweden are amazing destinations. If you want to experience one of the most spectaculair nature phenomenaâ€™s definitely fly up here to chase the Northern lights.</li>
                <br>
                <li>Our number seven is Slovenia. Lake bled is one of the most beautiful lakes I have seen. The country itself is one of the richest countries in Eastern Europe. It is very clean, safe and the people are very friendly.</li>
                <br>
                <li>Our top 8 is Copenhagen. It is one of the most trendy cities of Europe with amazing shopping and cute little bars. The architecture here is very colorful and it is one of the safest cities in Europe.</li>
                <br>
                <li>Our top 9 is Barcelona. There is something special about big cities which lie near the oceans. The Gaudi architecture is something out of a fairy tale and the Spanish tapas are delicious.</li>
                <br>
                <li>Bosnia (Eastern Europe) yes it is definitely off the beaten path. But the culture here is like you will find it no-where else. In Mostar you will find Islamic influences as well as Christian influences and you often feel like you are in Turkey when you stroll the market streets here. It is a short bus-ride to Croatia and Montenegro from here.</li>
